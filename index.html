              <h2>Meal-Orderer (2017)</h2>
              <p>A meal orderering app. Allows companies to collect lunch orders for their employees. Wrote the back-end with Ruby on Rails and the front-end with React.</p>

              <h2>Dungeoneer (2016)</h2>
              <p>Dungeoneer is a simple 2D dungeon-crawling game. Players must traverse a dungeon filled with skeletons, zombies, and forgotten warriors in as little time as possible, dying as few times as possible. Dungeoneer is based on RuneScape's dungeoneering skill. I wrote the game logic in JavaScript and the map generator in Elixir. The rendering was done with Pixi.js.</p>

              <p>A (incomplete) 2D capture-the-flag game built using the same tools as Dungeoneer. I wrote the game server in Node and the client-side renderer in JavaScript and Pixi.js.</p>

              <h2>TigerZone (2016)</h2>
              <p>A school project to implement the board game Carcassone. We were instructed to create a version of Carcassone and an AI that can against other AIs through TCP in a tournament at the end of the semester. I wrote the front-end for our application, which allows human vs human, human vs CPU, or CPU vs CPU gameplay. I also helped write our TCP adapter that allowed our AI to communicate with other AIs.</p>

              <h2>Nao Robot (2016)</h2>
              <p>A simple and straightforward interface that allows a user to control a Nao robot (specifically text-to-speech) and view engagement levels over time with an Insight brain-computer interface. This ultimately allows a user to craft the Nao robot's dialogue based on their level of engagement, i.e. if the user is disengaged, the robot will switch to a more interesting topic. I wrote the code for controlling the robot's text-to-speech function as well as the functionality to measure and monitor user engagement.</p>

              <p>Like Amazon, Sahara is an online store, only devoid of life and pretty much useless for humans. However, it functions as a great exercise for front-end and back-end development using Angular and Django. </p>
